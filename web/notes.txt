-- Deploy Steps
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod -d dist

-- Debugging
To run in local debug mode which means we pull data from the localhost version of VisualGitAPI at 
    https://localhost:7005/api/gitinternals

comment out the calls in main.ts->PerformUpdate()

to run locally and pull data from prod version of VisualGitAPI append the below to the url (replacing data=name)
visualize/?data=Crandon/1

and provide the API url too - so for Cloud.google
visualize/?api=https://vgit-api-729645510879.australia-southeast1.run.app&data=Crandon/1

and for Azure container app
visualize/?api=https://visual-git-api.livelyforest-4bf24ad1.australiasoutheast.azurecontainerapps.io&data=Crandon/1

-- Creating InnoSetup package

Open the pulbic\applications\innoSetup.iis files
Run 'Compile'
visualgit_setup.exe will be created in public\application\Output folder
It pulls the visualgit.exe directly from our local folder here:
    C:\github\VisualGit\public\application\Windows
So need to copy over the published version from here first
    C:\github\VisualGitCmd\bin\Release\net8.0\win-x64\publish

--------------- How does the build number work with Jenkins
Jenkins passes the build number on the cli and Astro has built in framework to handle
this. There is a change in the astro.config.mjs file to store It
and then in main.ts we access it with this line
const webversion = __BUILD_NUMBER__;
It is then set in the BuildVersion LitElement control
